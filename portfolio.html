	<h3>For this project we used if statements and for loops to gather input from users to customize and interact with their own virtual pet.<h3>
	<h2>1.2.5 Project</h2>
     <img src="Snakes and Ladders Project.PNG" height="300">
      <br>
	<h3>In this project we recreated the popular game of chutes and ladders as a virtual version. Following the requirements, we used existing turtle methods and created different aspects such as a virtual dice and timer.<h3>
	<h2>Scrath Project</h2>

	<h3>Doggy Volley is a two-player space-themed volleyball game. In Doggy Volley, you can customize your background while listening to fun upbeat background music. The first player to eight points wins.<h3>
	<h2>2.1.6 Project</h2>

      <br>
	<h3>This project involved having to find security issues within a system that led to a breach. We also had to use debugging methods to find issues in the code for a fish tank condition checker system.<h3>
	<h2>4.1.4 Project</h2>

      <br>
	<h3>For this project we used Net Logo's virtual modeling simulations to see the effects of different dosages of antibiotics on bacteria of different reproduction rates.<h3>
	<h2>3.1.6 Project</h2>
     <img src="Rocky Mountains.jpg" height="300">
      <br>
	<h3>For this project, we tried to detect where the rover went lost on an alien planet. We used our knowledge of lights, gyroscopes, sound and temperature to try to identify which type of land the rover was on. We ended up choosing that the rover was in the Rocky Mountains. We thought this because our temperature graph had numerous spikes which could show how the temperatures heated up quickly. Also with the bright constant light, this is shown in our light graph where it increases immensely and then plateus, representative of the occasional clouds. A low constant howl is shown by our sound graph that stayed pretty constant. Finally, the constant winds with varied intensities is demonstrated through our gyroscope graph because it remains constant but also has a lot of differing intensities, all while staying centered around 0. This is why we believe that the rover is in the Rocky Mountains.<h3>
	<h2>3.2.4 Project</h2>

	<h3>For this project, also called Honey as an Indicator, we downloaded data from a government website about the production of honey in order to see the trends of honey bees. We then used this data to create numerous different types of graph and analyze the trends of honey and synthesize from this, the trend of bee colonies.<h3>
